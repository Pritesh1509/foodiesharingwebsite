I have created a new post using a frontend form, and the entry is displayed from the backend. The entry is stored in the Recipe custom post type.
I have developed a Recipes listing on the archive page and a dedicated detail page.
The frontend form can be used anywhere on any page or post and is manageable via a shortcode.
The Reels section on the website is managed using a custom post type and an ACF video URL and managable by shortcode so use can anywhere post/page, which can be shared on WhatsApp and Facebook.
